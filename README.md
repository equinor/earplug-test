## Operational Status

[CI in ServiceNow](https://equinor.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=cmdb_ci_spkg.do?sys_id=31ec3a7633870290a3c5ab223d5c7b31)

## Description

Earplug Test/Dempings app is fulfilling this business purpose: This software/attenuation app will provide a better fit-testing system for hearing protection (earplugs) in noisy working environments. Ensuring that hearing protection has the intended effect will prevent work-related hearing loss (WRIs). This system will enable Equinor to verify the effectiveness of its noise barriers, as requested by Havtil. The application has no integration to any Equinor-managed application.

Contact operational unit for access.

## Development

### Running the app locally

*You need to use a Mac with Xcode installed for this to work*

#### Step 1: Install packages

```shell
npm install
```

#### Step 2: Prebuild the project

```shell
npm run prebuild
```

You can also do a clean prebuild

```shell
npm run prebuild -- --clean
```

#### Step 3: Run the project on an iOS simulator

```shell
npm run ios
```

You can also select device to run it on. Your physical devices will show up if connected.

```shell
npm run ios -- --device
```

#### Troubleshooting

expo has a tool called `expo-doctor` that can help you troubleshoot issues in the project. To use it, run:

```shell
npm run doctor
```

Doing a *clean* prebuild will often solve issues.

#### Further information

More information about expo-cli can be found [here](https://docs.expo.dev/more/expo-cli/)
